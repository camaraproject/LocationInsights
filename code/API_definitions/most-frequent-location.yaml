  title: Most Frequent Location
  description: |
    The Most Frequent Location API provides customers with the ability to verify the frequency of a device's location within a specific geographic area.

    # Introduction

    This API verifies if a device is present most of the time in a certain location. This location insight is useful as an approach to the residence location of the user.

    This API can be used in anti-fraud cases where a service provider needs further evidence about the reported place of residence of the customer. Also, for service provision or personalization tasks when the service provider needs to manage their offer depending on the habits of the customer.

    Such use cases are transversal to different sectors such as:

      - Financial institutions: to mitigate risks about identity fraud, helping in their compliance with AML/KYC regulation.
      - Insurance companies: to assess risks and prevent fraudulent claims.
      - E-commerce and retail: to ensure accurate shipping and delivery, fraud prevention and targeted marketing.
      - Digital Content Delivery companies: to verify service provisioning and billing, and to comply with regulation.
      - Utilities: to verify service provisioning and billing, and to prevent service theft.
      - Real estate: to screen potential tenants and ensure that lease agreements are in compliance with local laws.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: Any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.

    * **Geographical reference**: Using coordinates or a reference code, the geographical surface where a device can be physically located is specified.

    * **Verification**: The process triggered on the API server to calculate the frequency of time a device is at a given location.

    # API functionality

    The API allows customers to verify how often a device is in a specific location. The location can be specified using a geographical reference of type:
      - `COVERAGE_ZONE`: It is specified by latitude and longitude coordinates. The coverage area is generated by one or more antennas closest to the specified coordinates, determining the device's connection to these antennas.
      - `POSTAL_CODE`: A zip code or postal code that delimits a geographic area.

    The operation returns a score representing how frequently the device was connected to antennas whose coverage cover the requested area in certain time slots. The range of score values is between "0" and "100", where higher scores indicate a more frequent presence in the location.

    The `score` value maps to the frequency as follows:
      - `score = 0`: The device has never been in the specified location.
      - `score = 100`: The device is almost always in the specified location.

    # Identifying a device from the access token

    This specification defines the `device` object field as optional in API requests, specifically in cases where the API is accessed using a 3-legged access token, and the device can be uniquely identified by the token. This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers by relying on the device information associated with the access token used to invoke the API.

    ## Handling of device information:

    ### Optional device object for 3-legged tokens:

    - When using a 3-legged access token, the device associated with the access token must be considered as the device for the API request. This means that the device object is not required in the request, and if included it must identify the same device, therefore **it is recommended NOT to include it in these scenarios** to simplify the API usage and avoid additional validations.

    ### Validation mechanism:

    - The server will extract the device identification from the access token, if available.
    - If the API request additionally includes a `device` object when using a 3-legged access token, the API will validate that the device identifier provided matches the one associated with the access token.
    - If there is a mismatch, the API will respond with a 403 - INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT error, indicating that the device information in the request does not match the token.

    ### Error handling for unidentifiable devices:

    - If the `device` object is not included in the request and the device information cannot be derived from the 3-legged access token, the server will return a 422 `UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE` error.

    ### Restrictions for tokens without an associated authenticated identifier:

    - For scenarios which do not have a single device identifier associated to the token during the authentication flow, e.g. 2-legged access tokens, the `device` object MUST be provided in the API request. This ensures that the device identification is explicit and valid for each API call made with these tokens.

        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE1: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.

        NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
